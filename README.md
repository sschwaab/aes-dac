If you've ever found yourself running out of analog outputs on your digital mixer, you know the frustration. Maybe you have an extra stereo AES output—like we do—but no compatible gear to take it as an input.

That’s where this little device comes in. It takes the AES output of your console and converts it into a clean, balanced, line-level XLR signal (+4 dBu).

Sure, there are commercial solutions out there. But they often target high-end studio applications, making them unnecessarily expensive—sometimes costing as much as your entire mixer! We believe that great sound shouldn't come with an outrageous price tag.

Powered by a standard 9V power supply—just like your favorite guitar effects pedals—this device is easy to integrate into your setup. No frills, no overkill—just a simple and affordable solution that gets the job done.
